They are the best workouts for the back, core, and legs. Have fun finding some new favorite cardio exercises from the list above. But i wanted to share some of the workouts i’ve created over the years that have a lot of cardio exercises (e.g., jumping jacks, jump squats, high knees, etc.) worked in.
