Can You Exercise to Get a PearShaped Body? Healthfully From ehow.com
Running is cardio and burns fat. If you don&#39;t want to or aren&#39;t able to run for a solid hour, consider breaking your workout into smaller chunks, spaced throughout the day, of at least 10 to 15 minutes at a time. The only way to slim down thighs is to lose weight. Of course, cycling improves your leg muscles, but as an aerobic exercise, it works your endurance muscle fibers, making them more resistant to fatigue while training, but not causing them to bulk up.
