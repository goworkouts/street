<p>Diastolic dysfunction is linked to excessive weight, diabetes, age and limited physical activity or a sedentary lifestyle. Is it possible to reverse my diastolic dysfunction (dd), stage one with e/a ratio of.7 at my female age of 63? Diastolic dysfunction often produces a significant reduction in exercise capacity and can lead to a type of heart failure known as diastolic heart failure. Common signs of heart failure can include:</p>
