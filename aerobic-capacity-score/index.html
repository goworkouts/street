Resistance training, flexibility (actually, it’s more appropriate to call it “mobility,” but that’s a subject for another blog on another day) and cardiorespiratory training. Aerobic capacity (vo 2max) is a strong health and performance predictor and is regarded as a key physiological measure in the healthy population and in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwms).however, no studies have tried to synthesize the existing knowledge regarding vo 2max in pwms. Maximal aerobic speed (mas) is a term used to describe the lowest running speed at which vo2 max occurs (maximum oxygen uptake).
