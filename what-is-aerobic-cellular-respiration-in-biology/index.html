<p>Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are processes that seem to directly oppose each other. Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and procedures that occur in the cells of organisms to transform chemical energy from oxygen molecules or food into adenosine triphosphate and after that release waste products. The first stage of cellular respiration, called glycolysis, takes place in the cytoplasm. The process by which mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to atp is known as cellular respiration. Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration sciencemusicvideos.</p>

<p>It is a process when glucose is broken down to carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen to produce energy in the form of atp. In addition to aerobic respiration, there is also anaerobic respiration, which is the conversion of sugars into energy in environments where oxygen isnât present. On the other hand, anaerobic bacteria, yeast cells, prokaryotes, and muscle cells perform anaerobic respiration.
