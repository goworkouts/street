What&#39;s the Difference Between Aerobic and Anaerobic Exercise? Aaptiv From aaptiv.com
Depending on which discipline you are using, the metabolic process is different for each. Aerobics takes more endurance than anaerobics because it goes on for much longer while anaerobics are done in quick bursts of intense energy. Anaerobic training is more intense and demands a faster energy source. Aerobic means ‘with air’ and refers to the body producing energy with the use of oxygen.

<p>3.aerobic exercises help in toning the muscles and improve circulation while anaerobic exercises help in strengthening the bones and reducing muscle atrophy with age. Therefore, the body produces and then uses lactate as its fuel source, fed by glycogen. Aerobic training uses oxygen to create atp to power the lungs and muscles. Aerobics takes more endurance than anaerobics because it goes on for much longer while anaerobics are done in quick bursts of intense energy.
