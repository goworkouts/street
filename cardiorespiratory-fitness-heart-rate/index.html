The greater the peak oxygen uptake (vo2 max.), more efficiently the individual burns oxygen and thus more efficient is the functioning of his/her cardiorespiratory system and hence more is the cardiorespiratory fitness. The most predictive hr feature was the intercept of the linear. Participating in regular cardiorespiratory exercise is an excellent way to improve your health. The importance of v ˙ o 2 max as predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality has been recently highlighted by a scientific statement issued by the american heart association.

<p>What are 5 cardiorespiratory exercises. This report provides normative reference standards for cardiorespiratory fitness by cardiovascular disease category for both men and women performing testing on a treadmill or cycle ergometer, which can optimize the clinical value of cardiorespiratory fitness assessments. The greater the peak oxygen uptake (vo2 max.), more efficiently the individual burns oxygen and thus more efficient is the functioning of his/her cardiorespiratory system and hence more is the cardiorespiratory fitness. People of all ages need to be physically active for at least 30 minutes a day to maintain good health, but cardiorespiratory fitness is necessary for older adults.
