<p>In a months time i have gone from 26% bf to 22% and gained 7lbs of muscle and gained 4 lbs overall. In that case, you’ll likely be running six to seven days a week. But i was wondering if its ok to do cardio exercises for 5 days every week? If you're doing 2 days a week of hard cardio (somewhere in the 80 to 85% max hr range for over 30 minutes) and 5 days a week of light to moderate cardio then i'd probably say you could do this, but that depends on the type of cardio as well.
