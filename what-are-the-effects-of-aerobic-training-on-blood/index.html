Effect of 10week aerobic exercise training on systolic blood pressure From researchgate.net
Effects of aerobic training progression on blood pressure in individuals with hypertension: The purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of aerobic and anaerobic training programs applied to elite wrestlers on body mass index (bmi) and blood lipids. Exercise training (et) with blood flow restriction (bfr) is becoming increasingly popular, but the majority of bfr et studies have evaluated skeletal muscle strength and hypertrophy. This study investigated the effects of aerobic exercise training programme on blood cholesterol profile as cardiovascular disease risk factor among adolescents.

<p>Exercise training (et) with blood flow restriction (bfr) is becoming increasingly popular, but the majority of bfr et studies have evaluated skeletal muscle strength and hypertrophy. These effects have been proposed to be paralleled in tumours, such that aerobic exercise training may cause adaptations that modulate tumour blood flow through increased blood vessel density and improved organisation and vessel function [8, 13]. The aerobic exercise training consists of a warm up period for 5 minutes, walking on treadmill at 4 km per hour speed for 20 minutes and cooling down for another 5 minutes.
