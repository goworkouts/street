<p>The cardiovascular system or circulatory system is a system that moves nutrients, gases, and wastes between cells helps fight diseases and transports blood throughout the body (circulatory system). Your heart, blood vessels and blood itself are three essential components the body needs to survive. This is the tubing of the cardiovascular system that needs to be flexible, have elasticity and be able to easily expand and contract. These components make up two circulatory systems:</p>
