<p>Need a gym routine for weight loss and toning? If we estimate that your metabolism would use 50 calories per day to sustain that muscle, this means you will burn 250 more calories every day (50 calories/day x 5 pounds). So that means you don’t have to be in excellent shape and you don’t even need to have a base level to start out. While calories and macronutrients are important, the ideal gym diet must be one that positively influences health.</p>
