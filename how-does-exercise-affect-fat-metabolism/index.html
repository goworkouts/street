<p>It is currently unknown whether caloric deficits involving dieting, as opposed to exercise, can influence the relative loss of subcutaneous versus visceral adipose tissue. Either may be the predominant source, depending upon the duration and intensity of exercise, the degree of prior physical conditioning, and the composition of the diet consumed in the days prior to a bout of exercise. Exercise has a powerful action on metabolism, and adaptation of the body to changes induced by exercise is fundamental to be able to provide the energy required for muscle contraction and physiological functions of vital tissues.
