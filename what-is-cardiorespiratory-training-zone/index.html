Barrett&#39;s Fitness Query…I want to loose weight, should I just do From barrettsfitness.blogspot.com
Training in this zone will boost endurance and the efficiency with which you use fat and carbohydrates as fuel. Oxygenated blood carries the nutrients the body needs to function effectively. This is the very low intensity zone. The moderate heart rate zone is from 64% to 76% of your maximum heart rate.

<p>A heart rate training zone is a range that defines the upper and lower limits of training intensities. The blue zone improves overall health, though it doesn’t do a lot to increase aerobic capacity. Exercise heart rate zones are the training levels based on your maximum heart rate. Zone 4, or 80 to 90 percent of your heart rate max, is too intense to sustain for a long time.</p>
