What does aerobic respiration produce? Quora From quora.com
It is a type of respiration that requires oxygen to occur, and produces water, carbon dioxide and atp. It is a cyclic aerobic process taking place in the matrix of mitochondria to break down pyruvic acid into carbon dioxide in the presence of certain enzymes. Heterotrophic metabolism:.most familiar respiratory process (aerobic respiration) uses oxygen as the final electron acceptor.
