Electrical signals control your heartbeat. Telemetry nurses are specially trained to utilize and interpret technological devices that monitor the internal functioning and vital signs of a patient. Only difference is that a small transmitting device is attached to the person which transmits to the receiver elsewhere. When it is used appropriately it is a valuable diagnostic tool that assists in diagnosing and managing specific abnormal heart rhythms.
