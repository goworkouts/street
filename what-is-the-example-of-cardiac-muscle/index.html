Cardiac muscle tissue is found in the heart, has a striated appearance, and contains intercalated discs which increase the spread of an electrical stimulation. This feature, however, also distinguishes it from smooth muscle, the third muscle type. They regulate the contraction and relaxation of the heart, which helps in pumping blood through the circulatory system. Cardiac muscle, which is also called myocardium, in the vertebrates, is one of three major muscle types that is only found in the heart.
