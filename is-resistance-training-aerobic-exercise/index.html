In fact, a 2014 study in diabetologia found that a combined routine of both aerobic and resistance training is the best way to reduce blood sugar. After the 10 week resistance program, 80 percent of the subjects had on exercise completions, glucose levels within the normal range, while only 20 percent of the aerobic group were able to meet the target. Aerobic exercise is helpful to improve circulation and to burn calories and, if done long enough, to also help burn fat stores. Which is Better? Aerobic Exercise or Resistance Training?.</p>

<p>Aerobic exercise increases production of insulin, the hormone that helps your body take up sugar. When aerobic exercise precedes strength training, any muscle strength impairments are limited to the muscle groups used in the prior aerobic training. These can be performed one or more days per week, depending on the training season (1). We infer that the period of the study was too short to observe the full effects of aerobic and resistance exercise on endothelial cell function.
