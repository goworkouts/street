<p>Vascular plants are the green plants, which have specialized tissues for transporting food, water and minerals to all parts of the plant. Vascular plants can grow large and tall. After gaining vascular systems, plants were able to circulate water and nutrients more efficiently, thus being able to grow larger, have more leaves, develop branched systems of roots and shoots. Plant vascular systems consist of xylem, concerned mainly with the conduction of water and dissolved minerals, and phloem, which functions mainly in the conduction of foods, such as sugar.

<p>Due to these vascular tissues, these types of plants do not need a very specific environment to grow, that is, it can vary in. The arctic flora is estimated to represent less than 1% of the known vascular plant species in the world, and include relative few endemic species, and no endemic family or genera. The arctic flora consist of about 2200 species, distributed among 430 genera and 91 families (daniëls et al., 2013, elven et al., accessed 2021).

<p>Vascular tissue is an arrangement of multiple cell types in vascular plants which allows for the transport of water, minerals, and products of photosynthesis to be transported throughout the plant. The tissues through which the nutrients, mineral salts and water that vascular plants need for development circulate are distributed throughout their structure. They are the most visible green plants around us, so much so that the term plants generally means vascular plants. Vascular plants possess a chemical known as lignin, which is a complex polymer of phenolic compounds.lignin is incorporated into an additional cell wall layer, known as the secondary (2 °) wall (figure 4.3), which is found in certain, specialized cells of vascular plants.secondary walls are secreted to the outside of the plasma membrane (between the plasma membrane and the.
