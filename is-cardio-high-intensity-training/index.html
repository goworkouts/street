20 Minute High Intensity Interval Cardio Workout/ HIIT for Weight Loss From youtube.com
It is full blast cardio for seconds instead of minutes. Perform a long lsc session before strength training, as it can interfere with strength gains if done before. Although the best high intensity cardio workout can be debated just as many other things, it is in my belief that two variables greatly add to and increase the value of a high intensity workout. But in the last 10 to 15 years, hiit workouts—high intensity interval training—have gained a lot of momentum, opening up a debate about which regimen actually provides a better workout or more health benefits.
