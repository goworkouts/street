Sufficient high quality evidence suggesting high intensity progressive resistance strengthening is an effective and safe means of improving functional outcomes in older adults when compared to no or minimal intervention. Build strength to age well! The benefits of progressive resistance training.</p>

<p>High intensity resistance training (hirt) is essentially resistance training for fat loss, and like hiit, it really is a big deal. Training session length ranged from 45 to 90 minutes. Program duration ranged from 8 to 52 weeks, with participants attending 2 to 3 sessions. Thus, your heart rate will stay elevated and your muscles will be given very little time to recover before.

Sufficient high quality evidence suggesting high intensity progressive resistance strengthening is an effective and safe means of improving functional outcomes in older adults when compared to no or minimal intervention. The purpose of this paper is to describe the methodology we utilized for implementing a prt program to avoid publication bias, enable replication of the study and share a novel program.</p>
