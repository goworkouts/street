You really don’t need a load of equipment. Doing a cardio workout at home is more convenient than you might think. Set an interval timer to 30/20 or 30/15 seconds of work/rest. This is a very basic cardio exercise for beginners, even advanced level person also performs this workout, though most of them do it to warm up their body, you as a beginner can utilize jumping jacks for cardio.
