An exercise such as running can be both aerobic and anaerobic, depending on the pace you keep up. Resting hr decreases with aerobic training and is lower at any given workload.

<p>Your heart rate determines which zone you're working in during exercise. Energy production must increase to meet demand. Mitochondria uses oxygen to produce energy, leading to higher vo2 readings. These adaptations profoundly impact the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems (the two most affected organ systems), enabling more efficient oxygen delivery, endurance capacity, and improved performance.</p>

<p>In response to acute exercise, blood flow is markedly. The tenability of this assumption was examined for cardiac, vascular and hormonal responses respectively. •the sns response includes generalized peripheral vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles and increased myocardial contractility, an increased heart rate, and an increased systolic blood pressure. This study systematically reviewed the available scientific evidence pertaining to the acute and chronic changes promoted by aerobic exercise (ae) combined with blood flow restriction (bfr) on neuromuscular, metabolic and hemodynamic variables.

<p>Resting hr decreases with aerobic training and is lower at any given workload. This increase in demand forces the body to instantaneously make adjustments to the working systems and eventually adapt. The five major immediate physiological responses to training include heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, ventilation and lactate levels. With muscular hypertrophy training we will see greater peaks in breathing rates at the end of each set than we would for strength training as lactate starts to accumulate requiring oxygen to help metabolise it.

<p>This increase in demand forces the body to instantaneously make adjustments to the working systems and eventually adapt. As a result the predominant energy system and fuel source used changes throughout the exercise in order to maintain the required level of performance. Oxygen is provided by blood flow, and, in essence, changes in organ perfusion are also closely associated with alterations in tissue metabolism. A study by wallner et al.

When you begin to exercise your body must immediately adjust to the change in activity level. Aerobic literally means relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. The primary benefit of aerobic training is the increase in oxygen uptake levels.</p>
