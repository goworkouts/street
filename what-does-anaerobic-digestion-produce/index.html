The result is known as renewable energy or alternative energy. All the co² released was absorbed by the organic material during its lifecycle, and when new material grows the co² is reabsorbed. In europe, energy crops are grown for plants dedicated to anaerobic digestion, called biogas plants. The result is known as renewable energy or alternative energy.
