Unit 5 Metabolism From mrrittner.weebly.com
Name the phase which is common for both aerobic and anaerobic respiration? Aerobic glycolysis is exactly the same series of reactions as anaerobic (fast) glycolysis, except it just has a different outcome because sufficient oxygen is present. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Glucose is then broken down by a series of enzymes.
