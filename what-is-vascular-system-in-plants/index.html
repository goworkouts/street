Introduction to Vascular Plant Structure Digital Atlas of Ancient Life From digitalatlasofancientlife.org
The vascular system in a plant plays an important role in the life of these herbal being. The plant vascular system is made up of two networks of tubes, known as the xylem and phloem, which are the water and food conducting systems. Vascular plants contain these conducting tissues in different types of arrangements. It conducts water, nutrients, sugars, proteins and rna through the plant through lignified tissues.

<p>So the vascular system consists of xylem and phloem which are bundled together forming a vascular bundle. There are two main elements: The xylem transports water up from the roots and circulates it to all the other sections of the plantâs body. Vascular plants possess a chemical known as lignin, which is a complex polymer of phenolic compounds.lignin is incorporated into an additional cell wall layer, known as the secondary (2 Â°) wall (figure 4.3), which is found in certain, specialized cells of vascular plants.secondary walls are secreted to the outside of the plasma membrane (between the plasma membrane and the.

<p>The vascular system of a plant is the tissue and series of tubes and veins that move nutrients collected by the roots to the stem and leaves. The plant vascular system is made up of two networks of tubes, known as the xylem and phloem, which are the water and food conducting systems. Vascular plants possess a xylem, which transports food and water to the phloem. Vascular plants are those plants, which have specialised vascular tissues for the transport of water, minerals and food. Handson Activities to Study the Plant Vascular System Kristin Moon.</p>
