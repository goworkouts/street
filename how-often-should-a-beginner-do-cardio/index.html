How often should you do HIIT and how much? Fitness expert advice From stylist.co.uk
Training the cardiovascular system can be done in an aerobic (with the presence of oxygen) or anaerobic manner (without the presence of oxygen). There is no recommended upper limit on the amount of cardio exercise you should do on a daily or weekly basis. I usually have 2 sessions which result to 1 hour. If you only have one hour a day to hit the gym and exercise, this seems pretty reasonable.
