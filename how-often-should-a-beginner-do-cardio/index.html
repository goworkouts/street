How often should you do HIIT and how much? Fitness expert advice From stylist.co.uk

There is no recommended upper limit on the amount of cardio exercise you should do on a daily or weekly basis. I usually have 2 sessions which result to 1 hour. If you only have one hour a day to hit the gym and exercise, this seems pretty reasonable.
