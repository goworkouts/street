<p>After exercise, how will it take for the person’s heart rate to return to normal? As exercise intensity increases, the heart rate moves closer to its maximum rate. ‘’ during physical exercise, requirements for oxygen and substrate in skeletal muscle are increased, as are the removal. Therefore, the heart muscle can pump more volume of blood per beat than a normal person. ️ Hypothesis testing the effect of exercise on pulse rate. Effects on.</p>
