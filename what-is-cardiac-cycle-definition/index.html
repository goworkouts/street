3 stages of cardiac cycle. Cardiac cycle. 20190227 From rftp.com
The cardiac cycle may be divided into phases in any number of methods, for instance four phases [1,3] or seven phases [2].in the four phases method, the opening and closing of the heart valves explains this method of the cardiac cycle. Myocardiocytes are unique cells found in the heart that are able to independently. The contraction event is called systole and relaxation event is diastole.

<p>The contraction event is called systole and relaxation event is diastole. The cardiac cycle refers to the pattern of contraction and relaxation of the heart during one complete heartbeat. Hence when the heart rate is increased to 120 beats per minute, the cardiac cycle duration will be about. The series of muscular contractions which squeeze blood through the heart.
