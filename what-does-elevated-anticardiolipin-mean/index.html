A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies persisting when tested 12 weeks later, indicates continued presence of the antibody. In addition, the test results must be positive at least 2 occasions 12 or more weeks apart to validate the. The igm antibody recognizes a large variety of pathogenic antigens and plays an important role in body immunity.

<p>Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Cardiolipin antibodies are frequently seen with autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), and with other antiphospholipid antibodies, such as. A positive result supports the diagnosis only in the presence of thrombosis or fetal loss. Increased AntiPhospholipid Antibodies in Autism Spectrum Disorders.</p>
