There are various reasons for which cardiac enzyme test is advised by the doctor. The latter might be especially important for the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes occurring within the acute phase of stroke. Troponin is a protein released from myocytes when irreversible myocardial damage occurs. For this reason, blood tests for diagnosing heart attacks were originally.
