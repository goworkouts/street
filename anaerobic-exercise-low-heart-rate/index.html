Anaerobic exercise is any activity that breaks down glucose for energy without using oxygen. Anaerobic training has been shown to have several physical and psychological benefits, including boosting your mood and reducing your risk of heart disease and diabetes. Your respiration and heart rate differ in aerobic activities versus anaerobic ones. The anaerobic zone is slightly more intense than the aerobic zone.

Therefore, your heart muscle has to work less and beats less, which is a good thing. The anaerobic zone is 80 to 90 percent of your maximum heart rate. However, if you’ve worked out for speed, power, and strength, you’ll be making use of energy from anaerobic energy systems, which means you’ll endure less recovery time.
