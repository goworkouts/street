They recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise most days (or a total of about 150 minutes a week). Say, for example, that a fit person&#39;s heart beats 55 times per minute and an unfit person&#39;s heart beats 85 times per minute, a difference of 30 beats per minute. Exercise machines such as treadmills or exercise bicycles. With all the attention paid to the effect that aerobic exercise has on heart rate, you might think the only requirement for an effective workout is to increase your heart rate.

<p>More oxygen is also going to the muscles. Use the stethoscopes and timers to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time).

<p>This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time).

<p>The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time). Say, for example, that a fit person's heart beats 55 times per minute and an unfit person's heart beats 85 times per minute, a difference of 30 beats per minute.
