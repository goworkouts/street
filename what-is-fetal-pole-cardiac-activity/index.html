Early pregnancy ultrasonographic evaluation From slideshare.net
The fetal pole is a thickening on the margin of the yolk sac of a fetus during pregnancy.it is usually identified at six weeks with vaginal ultrasound and at six and a half weeks with abdominal ultrasound. Cardiac activity begins at 5 weeks 2 days, but may not be appreciated until embryo = 5mm in size, but should always be seen when embryo &gt; 5mm (6 weeks 4 days). In a healthy pregnancy, the fetal pole develops into a fetus. A missed abortion or miscarriage can be diagnosed on ultrasound (sonogram) with several different signs.

<p>The fetal pole is the first direct imaging manifestation of the fetus and is seen as a thickening on the margin of the yolk sac during early pregnancy.it is often used synonymously with the term embryo. Due to the fact that pregnancy dating can be wrong, it would be much. But it is easier for abortion activists to try to deny this. Transvaginal sonography (tvs) is the procedure of choice in evaluating the viability of embryos early in pregnancy.</p>

<p>In an early pregnancy ultrasound, if the embryo isn't far enough along to have developed into a recognizable fetus, the ultrasound tech will look to identify a fetal pole.
