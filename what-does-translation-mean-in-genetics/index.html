Why are prokaryotic promoter sequences written 5&#39; to 3 From biology.stackexchange.com
Information and translations of genetics, medical in the most comprehensive dictionary definitions resource on the web. Genetic distance, in short terms is the phrase used to define the number of variations, differences and mutations between two sets of dna results. Translation, as related to genomics, is the process through which information encoded in messenger rna (mrna) directs the addition of amino acids during protein synthesis. In prokaryotic translation 70s ribosomes with 30s and 50s subunits are used.
