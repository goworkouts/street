<p>Traditional strength training is weight lifting. Please correct me if iâm wrong traditional consists of a particular muscle like bicep curl, triceps extension, lateral raises etc. Jefit doesnât submit data to apple health because theyâre lazy/dumb so i defaulted to just using the other option for activity on. It does a decent job recognizing exercise and reps, but you'll still have to input a lot of the info on the watch. .</p>
