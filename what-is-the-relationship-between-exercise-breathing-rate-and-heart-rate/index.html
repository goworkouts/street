Use the timers and stethoscopes again to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. The more the heart beats, the more breathing occurs. This is especially true at extremes, such as when heart rate is very high or blood pressure is very low. Therefore,the pulse rate is essentially your heart rate.

<p>The american heart association notes that if you are calm, relaxed, not ill and are sitting or lying down, your resting heart rate is typically between 60 beats per minute and 100 bpm. Rsa is the product of interaction between baroreceptors (pressure sensors) and the medulla oblongata of the brainstem, where cardiac and breathing rhythms are generated. With increasing body work load and oxygen metabolic demands increasing, the heart rate will increase to increase the cardiac output and breathing rate. Now i do realize that some sports do use breathing techniques, so that is a different question. ð¥ How does the respiratory system help build social relationships.</p>
