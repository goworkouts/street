The tests measure enzyme levels in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). By doing a cardiac enzyme test, a doctor can first find out whether a heart attack has definitely occurred. Cardiac enzymes (the old name), or cardiac biomarkers (the new name), are blood tests that are used to detect damage to heart muscle cells. The timings of the results will depend on the type of test.
