Exercise allows the heart to pump blood more efficiently into the circulation as a result of stronger and more efficient cardiac contractions, greater blood perfusion of tissues and organs, and higher oxygen delivery. These hormones cause an increase in the heart rate and the force with which the heart contracts each beat. What Happens to the Cardiovascular System During Exercise?.</p>
