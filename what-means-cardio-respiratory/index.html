Cr abbreviation stands for cardio respiratory. The capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to provide oxygen to skeletal muscle mitochondria for energy synthesis during physical activity is referred to as cardiorespiratory fitness (crf). It is dependent on the function of the cardiorespiratory system (heart and lungs) and the cellular metabolic capacities. When you get an optimal volume of air in your lungs, it will produce an oxygen pressure.
