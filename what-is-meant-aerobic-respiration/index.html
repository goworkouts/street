The break down of food (like glucose) to release energy can occur in the presence of oxygen as well as in the absence of oxygen. Aerobic respiration happens in the presence of oxygen and releases more energy than anaerobic respiration. So, in the case of aerobic respiration, a larger amount of energy is produced as compared to anaerobic respiration process as complete oxidation takes place.
